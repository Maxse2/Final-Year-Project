1. Expand on bruteforce rule and implement other rules to be applied universally for each source
2 expand normalisation functionality for each normaliser ( particularly in terms of event classification )
3 Implement security features for data storage etc


Current bruteforce script is too generous with times causing bloat - alter bursts
"message" field is the same as raw in access log script -fix

Next rule - IMPOSSIBLE TRAVEL (or highly unlikely to be legitimate travel)

Required fields - User/username, SUCCESSFUL_LOGIN events, location representation (IP - thirdparty python library or web scraping), timedelta (period of time, predefined)
flow
1. two login events retrieved
2.ips compared (if same, return none), if IPs differ check with library function for impossible travel
3. flag as impossible travel ( potentially VPN use if linked to a known VPN server)
